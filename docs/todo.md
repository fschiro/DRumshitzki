1. dz_foward, dz_backward both use backward differences
  a. Need to compute forward differences for dz_forward
  b. repeat fix for r-direction

2. Add 2-layer boundary for intima-media
3. Re-create derivative scheme with beta coefficient variable names
4. Plan inverse, adding concentration to EC, concentration matrix docs
5. Rumschitzki two-sided difference scheme
